                <h1>What is cybersecurity?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware,
                    software and data from cyberthreats. The practice is used by individuals and
                    enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other
                    computerized systems.</p>
                <p>A strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture against
                    malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an
                    organization’s or user’s systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also
                    instrumental in preventing attacks that aim to disable or disrupt a system’s
                    or device’s operations.</p>
                <h3>Why is cybersecurity important?</h3>
                <p>With an increasing number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise,
                    combined with the increased deluge of data — much of which is sensitive or
                    confidential — the importance of cybersecurity continues to grow. The growing
                    volume and sophistication of cyber attackers and attack techniques compound
                    the problem even further.</p>
