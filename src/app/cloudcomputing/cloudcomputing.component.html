                <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers,
                     storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, 
                     and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation,
                      flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for 
                      cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your
                       infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.</p>
                <h3>Uses of cloud computing</h3>
                <p>You’re probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realize
                     it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, 
                     watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games, or store pictures and
                      other files, it’s likely that cloud computing is making it all possible
                       behind the scenes. A variety of organizations—from tiny startups to
                        global corporations, government agencies to non-profits—have embraced
                         cloud computing technology for all sorts of reasons.</p>
